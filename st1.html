        <p><b>Ans: </b>Once a farmer had a goose. It used to lay a golden egg every day. The farmer used to sell them in market and within a short time he became quite solvent. But his wife was very greedy. She wanted to be very rich overnight. She told herself "Surely, there are a good number of golden eggsin it's stomach. So there's no use of getting one egg a day. We can get all the eggs by cutting the belly of the goose." She suggested her husband to do so. But her husband was very intelligent. He did not agree with her proposal. One day when the farmer went to his farm, his greedy wife took a sharp knife and cut the belly of the goose. She did not find any egg. Infact, the goose died. Thus it is for her grred she lost all hopes of becoming prosperous.</p>
