        <p><b>Ans: </b>Once upon a time there was an old farmer. He lived with his wife and three sons in a small village.The three sons always quarrelled with each other. One day, the sons were quarrelling again and the old farmer heard them. In order to teach them the value of unity, he called his sons beside him and told them to bring three sticks and some rope for their father. The old farmer tied the sticks together with the rope. Then he asked his sons to break the bundle of sticks. The three boys tried and tried but couldn't break the bundle of sticks. Then their father untied the bundle and gave each of them one stick to break. This time they all broke the sticks easily. Then old farmer said them nobody could harm them if they remained united.</p>
